Sorry for all the guys who think they are protected because they bought an expensive commercial solution but you'd have to do this kind of work too, especially if you are a valuable target to attackers. I will not argue for hours about this but the main argument is that commercial solution are not bad per se, but they have to be generic enough to satisfy the more use cases as possible. Satisfying use cases is usually synonym of not having too many false positives, at the cost of discarding some true positives under some very specific/targetted environment.
