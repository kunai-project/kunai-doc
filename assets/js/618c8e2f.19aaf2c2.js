If that happens to you do not panic, it does not mean the tool is bad, it just means your kernel is not yet supported, for a reason or another. Having a single binary fitting to several kernels is great for deployment however this has a cost:\xa0the programs needs to be aware of some of the changes made between the kernel versions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration":{"id":"configuration","title":"Configuration","description":"By default kunai does not log all events it can monitor, so if you want to unlock the full potential of the tool, you need to configure it through a configuration file.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"events/bpf_prog_load":{"id":"events/bpf_prog_load","title":"Bpf prog load","description":"This event is generated every time a BPF\xa0program is loaded into the kernel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"events/connect":{"id":"events/connect","title":"Connect","description":"This event gets generated every time a connect attempt is made to a remote IP.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"events/dns_query":{"id":"events/dns_query","title":"Dns query","description":"This event is generated when the a DNS response is received on the host and gives insight both on the query, the response and the DNS\xa0resolver.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"events/execve":{"id":"events/execve","title":"Execve","description":"Execve events are generated whenever an execve syscall happens on the system.
