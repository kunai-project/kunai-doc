It addresses the need to log only events matching specific **IoCs**. Even though one can match IoC with detection rules it is not very convenient to manage for lots of IoCs and even less to automate. The other difference is on the resource management aspect. Detection rules has some non negligible processing/memory cost to work properly (find the rules to apply and then match against fields). On the other hand, IoC matching is reduced to a lookup in a set, so it is much more cpu and memory efficient.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/rule_configuration":{"id":"advanced/rule_configuration","title":"Configuration with Rules","description":"Using Kunai to monitor every single event happening on a system is nice as it gives a very deep insight of what is going on. However, this approach generates loads of events.
