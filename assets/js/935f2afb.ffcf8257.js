It addresses the need to log only events matching specific **IoCs**. Even though one can match IoC with detection rules it is not very convenient to manage for lots of IoCs and even less to automate. The other difference is on the resource management aspect. Detection rules has some non negligible processing/memory cost to work properly (find the rules to apply and then match against fields). On the other hand, IoC matching is reduced to a lookup in a set, so it is much more cpu and memory efficient.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/rule_configuration":{"id":"advanced/rule_configuration","title":"Configuration with Rules","description":"Using Kunai to monitor every single event happening on a system is nice as it gives a very deep insight of what is going on. However, this approach generates loads of events. While it might be the way to go for some Kunai users, some others might be interested into detecting only very specific events (based on configurable rules) and show only those ones. This is exactly the topic we are going to tackle in this section of the documentation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli":{"id":"cli","title":"CLI Usage","description":"Some of the configuration options can be set directly from CLI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"compatibility":{"id":"compatibility","title":"Compatibility","description":"Kunai has been built to be compatible with all the Linux LTS kernels(from 5.4 to 6.6 at the time of writing).

It reflects a scenario where the event monitor cannot keep up with the kernel\'s pace. Such occurrences are inevitable when Kunai is configured to log very frequent events, such as file system activities (read, write, filecreated, fileunlink, etc.). While these events are valuable for detailed analysis, the high frequency may lead to unavoidable losses.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"events/execve":{"id":"events/execve","title":"Execve","description":"This event is generated when a new process is created using one of the execve system calls. execve system calls are used to execute a program within the context of an existing process, replacing the current process image with a new one.
