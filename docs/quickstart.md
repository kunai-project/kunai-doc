# Quick Start

Before going further, please make sure you've read the [compatibility](compatibility) page.

You don't need to do a lot in order to evaluate what **kunai** is capable of, just launch the binary with a **privileged user** and you should see a bunch of events flowing in your terminal ! In order to understand the events generated please refer to [events documentation](category/kunai---events).


```bash
sudo kunai
```

:::tip Why sudo ?
Kunai needs to load eBPF programs into the kernel so it requires elevated privileges
:::

You can try to make some activity on your host and see if kunai catches it properly. If not, do not stop using the tool, just let us know and we will fix that.
